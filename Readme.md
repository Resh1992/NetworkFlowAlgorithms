 
## Network Flow Algorithm

Implemented Ford-Fulkerson, Scaling Ford-Fulkerson, and Preflow-push algorithms in Java to find maximum flow in a network.
Performed empirical study with Random, Bipartite, Fixed Degree and Mesh graphs.
Varied multiple parameters affecting graph generation and studied its effect on the runtime of all algorithms.

## Running and building

Compile: Run command 'make' in src folder.

Run: After compiling run command 'javac tcss543 &lt;input file path&gt;'.

Clean: Run command 'make clean' in src folder.


** Important information:** If Stack overflow error comes for big graphs then pass -Xss2m as argument for java stack size i.e. run 'javac -Xss2m tcss543 &lt;input file path&gt;' command.
