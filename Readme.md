## Network Flow Algorithm

Implemented Ford-Fulkerson, Scaling Ford-Fulkerson, and Preflow-push algorithms in Java to find maximum flow in a network.
Performed empirical study with Random, Bipartite, Fixed Degree and Mesh graphs.
Varied multiple parameters affecting graph generation and studied its effect on the runtime of all algorithms.

## Running and building
To run the project 
run 'java tcss543 <input file>'


** Important information:** If Stack overflow error comes for big graphs then pass -Xss2m as argument for java stack size i.e. run java -Xss2m tcss543 <input file> command.

Compile: Run command make in src folder.

Clean: Run command make clean in src folder.
